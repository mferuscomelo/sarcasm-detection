# Sarcasm Detection

## Description
Created as an Applied Deep Learning Trainee as part of the MIT FutureMakers program, a collaboration between the MIT RAISE initiative and SureStart. More information on my work during the program can be found here: [https://github.com/mferuscomelo/mit-futuremakers](https://github.com/mferuscomelo/mit-futuremakers)

Code adapted from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/madz2000/sarcasm-detection-with-glove-word2vec-83-accuracy). Trained new model that increased accuracy to 92.95%.
